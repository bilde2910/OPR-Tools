Unofficial Tools for OPR
========================

This repository is still very much a work in progress. The goal is to port most of the addons from `tehstone's repo`_ from Wayfarer to OPR. At the same time, I'm taking the opportunity to do a major rework of the userscript structure to make the scripts much more pleasant and safe to code.

.. _tehstone's repo: https://github.com/tehstone/wayfarer-addons

If you want to be an early tester, you can install all of the OPR tools using this link:

Individual plugins are turned on and off from the Settings page on OPR.
